## Log of Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 2025

#### Description
Plan: Formulate what you want to work on during the challenge. It might be - learning a framework, or starting a journey of learning to code, or improving your skill level with a particular technology or a programming language. Don't spend too much time planning, but having a plan like this will help you on your path.

### Round 1 takeaways
Decided to code C++ for 100 days straight instead of jumping around python and doing a bunch of variety of things. My goal for this round is to code and/or learn new topics in C++ on this journey of 100 days. My C++ code could be implemented in anyway I see fit. I want to start by making command line games, then going to microcontroller logic to create fun projects. Just some ideas of where to go. Let's get going!

### Day 1: September 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Started up Blackjack game in C++. 

**Thoughts:** I have been having trouble finding out the plan to get into coding. I realized I should attempt to code only in C++ for this round and go from there. I hope to see some good progress in C++ in this journey.

### Day 2: September 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress** Started creating the deck attribute of the Blackjack game.

**Thoughts:** I am currently reading a C++ book to understand the language in more depth. I am on the Functions chapter, which will lead to pointers then to classes. The main thing I want to implement correctly in the Blackjack game is the classes. So right now I am tackling that topic of C++.

### Day 3: September 26. Friday

**Today's Progress** Looked into how to include header files into the project.

**Thoughts:** Looking into how to create and include header files into the project to allow for multifile projects.

### Day 4: September 27. Saturday

**Today's Progress** Researching how to structure a C++ project with the multiple variables.

**Thoughts:** I realized I should do more code reviews of other coders to see how they structure their projects according to their "industry standard".

### Day 5: September 28. Sunday

**Today's Progress** Looked through various GitHub Repositories in C++ to see file structure.

**Thoughts:** I want to implement a way to compile multiple files together seamlessly and faster as a C++ project.

### Day 6: September 29. Monday

**Today's Progress** Worked all day on the Blackjack project from researching makefiles to the actual gameplay mechanics.

**Thoughts:** File structures and the way projects are built can become a wild rabbit hole. It could range from multiple language projects to much more. I want to stick with just C++ in my project so I will implement CMake to allow for multiple file compilation and execution. I was able to complete the makefile and start on the project itself. Now looking into making the random number generation using the random standard library to allow for modern random number generation.

### Day 7: September 30. Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Learned more about pointers and references in C++ in detail. 

**Thoughts:** I have been wanting to review pointers and how to use them in greater detail which I have done today. I want to implement and practice with pointers to enforce my knowledge on the topic. I also learned about references and how useful the reference operator (&) is. With the reference operator, I can pass in a parameter that will not be copied again when using the function, thus improving performance of the code.

### Day 8: October 1. Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Working on my Blackjack Project and now I am trying to configure the debugger in VSCode to help me work on the project.

**Thoughts:** I am having trouble figuring out the debugger to work with multiple files in VSCode. I am going through websites and figuring out the .json files that are used to launch the debuggers in VSCode.

### Day 9: October 2. Thursday

**Today's Progress** Learned about classes and objects in the SamsTeachYourselfC++ book. 

**Thoughts:** I want to implement the classes in the blackjack game I am creating for practice and implementation of classes. I also want to include constructors, destructors, and the copy constructor.

### Day 10: October 3. Friday

**Today's Progress** Implemented classes in my blackjack project.

**Thoughts:** Had no problems implmeneting the deck and player class to accommodate drawing cards and gettings cards. However, had issues with the main blackjack class and sharing the deck class with the player and dealer.

 ### Day 11: October 4. Saturday

 **Today's Progress** Worked on Phidget VintHub I/O module

 **Thoughts:** The module allows the user to manipulate the hub's ports to have different modes including digital I/O or Voltage I/O. Phidget strives to make their devices "plug and program" to allow users to skip over the circuit creation and get straight to coding. Interfacing the module with Linux was fairly simple with a few steps to get it set up.


### Day 12: October 5. Saturday

**Today's Progress** Transitioning the Phidget VintHub I/O module to interface with Windows PC

**Thoughts:** I had trouble getting the whole setup due to memory issues on the laptop. Ended up changing laptops that had more memory storage. When trying to set up VSCode, Phidget libraries, and MinGW, I ended up having the most issues with MinGW. Right now I am trying to connect the Phidget library to compile with MinGW. 

### Day 13: October 6. Monday

**Today's Progress** Finished up writing the gameplay code for my Blackjack game.

**Thoughts:** Was interesting to think of how the gameplay for each round should be layed out. I had to think about when to clear the screen, when players should draw cards, and how to make the player experience the most engaging. This consisted of ensuring there is a cleared screen when playing the game with the menu displaying necessary attributes.

### Day 14: October 7. Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Added more engaging experience for the user playing the game

**Thoughts:** I added features that allow the player to have a menu display and a more "snappier" game experience. Tomorrow I want to implement CMake and learn how to use it. I also want to use it to help me debug some issues within the game to find out more details. I also want to make each day more impactful such as learning something new everyday no matter what it is. Today I learned more about the sleep threading and how to manage gameplay within the terminal. Tomorrow I want to tackle CMake and learn how to debug a multifile C++ project.

### Day 15: October 8. Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Learned more about CMake and doing the tutorial for CMake

**Thoughts:** I want to go through the tutorial and learn how to use CMake to then have the ability to debug a multifile C++ project. 

**Link** [CMake Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html)

#### **Took October 9 (Thursday) off**

### Day 16: October 10. Friday

**Today's Progress** Leetcode and job applications

**Thoughts:** I started a deadline for myself. 3 tasks I have to get done by the end of the week. (most of the days will include coding). 

1. Apply to 50 jobs throughout the week.
2. Complete 15 Leetcode Problems
3. Complete CMake tutorial
4. Guitar - get through Grade 2 of CAGED 2 course

I want to start making deadlines for myself to get things rolling and maintain a schedule. Today's progress focused on LeetCode and Job Search.
