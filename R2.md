## Log of Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 2025

#### Description
Plan: Formulate what you want to work on during the challenge. It might be - learning a framework, or starting a journey of learning to code, or improving your skill level with a particular technology or a programming language. Don't spend too much time planning, but having a plan like this will help you on your path.

### Round 1 takeaways
Decided to code C++ for 100 days straight instead of jumping around python and doing a bunch of variety of things. My goal for this round is to code and/or learn new topics in C++ on this journey of 100 days. My C++ code could be implemented in anyway I see fit. I want to start by making command line games, then going to microcontroller logic to create fun projects. Just some ideas of where to go. Let's get going!

### Day 1: September 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Started up Blackjack game in C++. 

**Thoughts:** I have been having trouble finding out the plan to get into coding. I realized I should attempt to code only in C++ for this round and go from there. I hope to see some good progress in C++ in this journey.

### Day 2: September 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress** Started creating the deck attribute of the Blackjack game.

**Thoughts:** I am currently reading a C++ book to understand the language in more depth. I am on the Functions chapter, which will lead to pointers then to classes. The main thing I want to implement correctly in the Blackjack game is the classes. So right now I am tackling that topic of C++.

### Day 3: September 26. Friday

**Today's Progress** Looked into how to include header files into the project.

**Thoughts:** Looking into how to create and include header files into the project to allow for multifile projects.

### Day 4: September 27. Saturday

**Today's Progress** Researching how to structure a C++ project with the multiple variables.

**Thoughts:** I realized I should do more code reviews of other coders to see how they structure their projects according to their "industry standard".

### Day 5: September 28. Sunday

**Today's Progress** Looked through various GitHub Repositories in C++ to see file structure.

**Thoughts:** I want to implement a way to compile multiple files together seamlessly and faster as a C++ project.

### Day 6: September 29. Monday

**Today's Progress** Worked all day on the Blackjack project from researching makefiles to the actual gameplay mechanics.

**Thoughts:** File structures and the way projects are built can become a wild rabbit hole. It could range from multiple language projects to much more. I want to stick with just C++ in my project so I will implement CMake to allow for multiple file compilation and execution. I was able to complete the makefile and start on the project itself. Now looking into making the random number generation using the random standard library to allow for modern random number generation.

### Day 7: September 30. Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Learned more about pointers and references in C++ in detail. 

**Thoughts:** I have been wanting to review pointers and how to use them in greater detail which I have done today. I want to implement and practice with pointers to enforce my knowledge on the topic. I also learned about references and how useful the reference operator (&) is. With the reference operator, I can pass in a parameter that will not be copied again when using the function, thus improving performance of the code.
