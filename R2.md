## Log of Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 2025

#### Description
Plan: Formulate what you want to work on during the challenge. It might be - learning a framework, or starting a journey of learning to code, or improving your skill level with a particular technology or a programming language. Don't spend too much time planning, but having a plan like this will help you on your path.

### Round 1 takeaways
Decided to code C++ for 100 days straight instead of jumping around python and doing a bunch of variety of things. My goal for this round is to code and/or learn new topics in C++ on this journey of 100 days. My C++ code could be implemented in anyway I see fit. I want to start by making command line games, then going to microcontroller logic to create fun projects. Just some ideas of where to go. Let's get going!
