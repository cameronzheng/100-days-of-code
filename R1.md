## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 2025

### Day 0: September 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Set up the 100DaysOfCode repo. Time to go strong! 100 more days to go consistently!

**Thoughts:** Also looking to do the Odin Project. I am tired of constantly going back and forth with Software Development, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. It's time to just dial in and be consistent. I want to do this coding challenge to start building projects in parallel to tackling the Odin Project and my guitar pedals. Motivation and Energy will waiver, but that's where the links from the Odin Project come in. Growth mindset: I can get better at anything with effort and persistence. The only way is forward.

### Day 1: September 7. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Snake, and created a repo for it. 

**Thoughts:** Had trouble figuring out .gitignore with the virtual environment files. Figured it out! Glad I was able to perservere and figure that out.
